## Abstract

This standard defines the interface for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Lux Network. It is equivalent to Ethereum's ERC-721, adapted as LRC-721 to promote interoperability and developer familiarity.

## Motivation

NFTs represent unique digital assets and require a common interface for minting, transferring, and querying ownership. A standardized NFT interface enables wallets, marketplaces, and contracts to interact seamlessly with any LRC-721 token on Lux.

## Specification

```solidity
interface ILRC721 {
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);
    function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address owner);
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) external;
    function getApproved(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address operator);
    function isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator) external view returns (bool);

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed approved, uint256 indexed tokenId);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed owner, address indexed operator, bool approved);
}
```

## Rationale

This interface is a direct 1:1 adoption of ERC-721, ensuring full compatibility with existing tooling and smart contracts. The LRC prefix clarifies that the standard is officially endorsed by the Lux Network.

## Backwards Compatibility

Any contract compliant with ERC-721 is automatically compliant with LRC-721. No changes to existing contracts are required.

## Test Cases

Reference tests are available in the standard implementation repository:
- Minting, transfer, and burn operations
- Approval and transferFrom scenarios
- Enumeration of tokens per owner and total supply

## Reference Implementation

See the canonical LRC-721 implementation in the `/standard` repository:
```text
/standard/contracts/LRC721.sol
/standard/contracts/extensions/LRC721Enumerable.sol
```

## Security Considerations

The security considerations for LRC-721 are inherited from ERC-721:
- Use safeTransferFrom to prevent tokens from being locked in non-compliant contracts.
- Prevent transfers to the zero address to avoid token loss.
- Manage approvals carefully to avoid unauthorized transfers.
