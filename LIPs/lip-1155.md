## Abstract

This LIP defines a flexible token contract that can hold multiple token types – fungible, non-fungible, or semi-fungible – in one contract. It covers the methods for batch transfers, the concept of token IDs (where an ID could represent a class of interchangeable tokens or a unique token).

## Motivation

The benefit of ERC-1155 is efficiency in contract deployment and batch operations, which this LIP will articulate for the Lux audience.

## Specification

```solidity
interface ILRC1155 {
    event TransferSingle(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256[] _ids, uint256[] _values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);
    event URI(string _value, uint256 indexed _id);

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data) external;
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] calldata _ids, uint256[] calldata _values, bytes calldata _data) external;
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] calldata _owners, uint256[] calldata _ids) external view returns (uint256[] memory);
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
}
```

## Rationale

By implementing LRC-1155, Lux caters to advanced use cases (like gaming or complex DeFi instruments) where a single contract manages many token types, saving gas and simplifying management.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LIP is compatible with the existing token standards.

## Security Considerations

Implementations of LRC-1155 should be careful to prevent reentrancy attacks and other known vulnerabilities.
