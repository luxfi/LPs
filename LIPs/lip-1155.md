## Abstract

This standard defines a multi-token interface that supports both fungible and non-fungible token behaviors in a single contract. It corresponds to Ethereum's ERC-1155, rebranded as LRC-1155 for the Lux Network.

## Motivation

Gaming and asset-management applications require the efficiency of batch operations and the flexibility to represent multiple token types. A single, unified standard for multi-token management reduces contract overhead and improves transaction efficiency.

## Specification

```solidity
interface ILRC1155 {
    function balanceOf(address account, uint256 id) external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] calldata accounts, uint256[] calldata ids)
        external view returns (uint256[] memory);
    function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) external;
    function isApprovedForAll(address account, address operator) external view returns (bool);
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external;
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256[] calldata ids, uint256[] calldata amounts, bytes calldata data) external;

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);
}
```

## Rationale

LRC-1155 directly mirrors ERC-1155 to maintain consistency with existing tooling and to leverage the benefits of batch transfers and reduced gas consumption.

## Backwards Compatibility

Any ERC-1155 compliant contract remains compliant with LRC-1155. No changes to existing implementations are necessary.

## Test Cases

Standard test suites cover:
- Single and batch transfers
- Approval and operator management
- URI metadata retrieval

## Reference Implementation

Canonical LRC-1155 implementations are available in the `/standard` repository:
```text
/standard/contracts/LRC1155.sol
/standard/contracts/extensions/LRC1155Supply.sol
```

## Security Considerations

Security considerations for LRC-1155 align with those of ERC-1155:
- Ensure batch operations handle mismatched array lengths correctly.
- Validate transfer recipient contracts to avoid token lockups.
- Prevent transfers to the zero address.
