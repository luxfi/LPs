## Abstract

This LIP specifies the Z-Chain, a new chain in Lux focused on privacy and security via zero-knowledge proofs (formerly LIP-0005). The Z-Chain integrates zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography to enable transactions or data that can be verified without revealing sensitive details.

## Motivation

The Z-Chain enables privacy-preserving applications and transactions, which are essential for many use cases in finance and other industries.

## Specification

*(This LIP will outline the purpose of Z-Chain: for example, it might allow confidential asset transfers, identity proofs, or compliance checks using zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs.)*

## Rationale

By having Z-Chain, Lux aims to offer the cutting edge of privacy tech in a standard way, and this LIP will be a reference for academics and developers on how to implement zero-knowledge in a live blockchain.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LIP is foundational and does not introduce backwards compatibility issues.

## Security Considerations

Security considerations for the Z-Chain include the security of the underlying zero-knowledge proof system, the prevention of double-spends in the shielded pool, and the management of trusted setups if required.
