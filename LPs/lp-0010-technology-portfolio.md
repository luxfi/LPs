# LP-0010: Technology Portfolio

## Abstract

Lux Network has developed a comprehensive portfolio of **100+ innovative technologies** across eleven core blockchain segments. We plan to apply for patent protection for these innovations. These innovations collectively enable "the fastest, most secure, and private quantum-safe network of blockchains."

| Segment | Innovations | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **DEX** | 10 | Planning |
| **Consensus** | 12 | Planning |
| **Threshold Cryptography** | 9 | Planning |
| **MPC** | 9 | Planning |
| **FHE/TFHE** | 8 | Planning |
| **AI Mining** | 6 | Planning |
| **Post-Quantum Crypto** | 15 | Planning |
| **Bridge/Cross-Chain** | 10 | Planning |
| **Wallet/KMS/HSM** | 13 | Planning |
| **EVM Precompiles** | 14 | Planning |
| **Enterprise Custody** | 8 | Planning |

**Note**: Hanzo AI infrastructure innovations (25+) are documented separately.

## Important Notice

**We plan to apply for patent protection for these technologies in the United States and United Kingdom.**

Due to patent laws that do not adequately protect inventors—particularly the US first-to-file system (since the America Invents Act of 2013) and UK law which provides no grace period for prior public disclosure—we are unable to share certain implementation details publicly until patent applications are filed. This legal reality unfortunately prevents us from fully open-sourcing some components of our work until we have secured at least provisional protection.

We believe these laws harm innovation and independent inventors, but must operate within them.

Implementation details and source code are released under the Lux Research License once patent applications are filed.

## Technology Categories (Summary)

### DEX Innovations
Novel approaches to decentralized exchange infrastructure including hardware-accelerated order matching, quantum-resistant consensus, and advanced margin trading systems.

### Consensus Innovations
Next-generation consensus protocols including post-quantum finality mechanisms, performance-weighted validator selection, and modular consensus architecture.

### Threshold Cryptography
Advanced threshold signature schemes including dynamic resharing, post-quantum lattice-based signatures, and comprehensive zero-knowledge proof frameworks.

### MPC (Multi-Party Computation)
Unified multi-protocol signature frameworks, non-disruptive key rotation, and Byzantine-resilient coordination mechanisms.

### FHE/TFHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)
Blockchain-optimized fully homomorphic encryption including deterministic random generation for consensus and efficient bootstrapping techniques.

### AI Mining & Confidential Compute
Quantum-safe AI compute verification, multi-provider TEE abstraction, and privacy-tiered reward systems.

### Post-Quantum Cryptography
Comprehensive NIST FIPS 203/204/205 implementations, lattice-based threshold signatures, and quantum-safe key management.

### Bridge & Cross-Chain
Replay-resistant cross-chain messaging, light client verification frameworks, and threshold-signed attestations.

### Wallet/KMS/HSM
Multi-curve HD wallet frameworks, air-gap protocols, social recovery mechanisms, and hardware wallet integrations.

### EVM Precompiles
Native blockchain precompiles for DEX operations, FHE computation, ring signatures, and dynamic fee mechanisms.

TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO - PATENT APPLICATIONS PLANNED
Contact: licensing@lux.network

This License grants:
(1) RESEARCH USE - Academic and non-commercial research only
(2) LUX ECOSYSTEM USE:
    - Lux Primary Network (Network ID=1, EVM Chain ID=96369)
    - Authorized testnets/devnets
    - L1/L2/L3 chains descending from Lux Primary Network
    - L1/L2/L3 chains descending from authorized testnets

## Motivation

Lux Network's competitive advantage stems from a comprehensive portfolio of innovations across every major blockchain segment. We plan to apply for patent protection for these technologies. This document serves as the canonical reference for the portfolio structure and licensing terms.

## Specification

This LP specifies the organizational structure and categorization of Lux Network's technology portfolio.

## Rationale

Withholding implementation details until patent applications are filed protects Lux Industries' intellectual property rights while maintaining transparency about the scope and categories of innovations.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LP is informational and does not affect network compatibility.

## Security Considerations

No security-sensitive implementation details are disclosed in this document.
