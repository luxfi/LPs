# LP-0099: LP Numbering Scheme (Canonical)

## Abstract

This LP is the **canonical governance anchor** for all Lux Proposals. It defines:
1. Reserved number ranges (hard rules)
2. Status semantics (enforceable)
3. Normative vs non-normative classification
4. Decision rules for LP placement

**Anything outside its designated range is invalid and MUST be renumbered.**

## Motivation

### Problems Solved

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Numbering drift | Reserved ranges with hard boundaries |
| Category bleed | Domain-first, not chain-first organization |
| Lifecycle confusion | Strict status semantics |
| Mixed normative/research | Explicit classification |

### Design Principles

1. **Domain-first**: Group by semantic domain, not chain identity
2. **Normative separation**: Standards vs research vs guides
3. **Machine-navigable**: Predictable ranges for tooling
4. **Protocol-enforceable**: Clear rules, no ambiguity

---

## Specification

### 🔒 Reserved Ranges (Hard Rules)

| Range | Purpose | Status Allowed |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **0–99** | Constitutional / Meta | Final only |
| **100–999** | Core Protocols | Draft, Final |
| **1000–1999** | Chain Specifications | Draft, Final |
| **2000–2999** | DAO, Governance & ESG | Draft, Final, Research |
| **3000–3999** | Solidity, Tokens & Web3 | Draft, Final |
| **4000–4999** | Cryptography / PQC | Draft, Final |
| **5000–5999** | AI / Attestation | Draft, Final |
| **6000–6999** | Bridges & Interop | Draft, Final |
| **7000–7999** | Threshold / MPC | Draft, Final |
| **8000–8999** | ZK / Privacy | Draft, Final |
| **9000–9999** | DeFi / Markets | Draft, Final |
| **10000–19999** | Learning Paths | Research only |
| **50000–59999** | Research Indexes | Research only |

**Rule**: LPs outside their designated range are INVALID.

---

### Status Semantics (Strict)

Each LP MUST declare exactly one status:

| Status | Meaning | Binding? |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Draft** | Actively evolving | No |
| **Final** | Normative standard | Yes |
| **Superseded** | Replaced, read-only | No |
| **Research** | Informational only | Never |

**Hard Rules**:
- Learning Paths (10000+) can NEVER be Final
- Research Indexes (50000+) can NEVER be Final
- Only ranges 0–9999 can reach Final status

## Validation Rules (LP-lint)

```yaml
# LP-lint rules (machine-enforceable)
rules:
  range_check:
    - "LP 0-99 MUST have status: Final"
    - "LP 10000+ MUST have status: Draft"
    - "LP 50000+ MUST have status: Draft"
    - "LP outside defined range is INVALID"
  
  status_check:
    - "status MUST be one of: Draft, Final, Superseded, Research"
    - "Research LPs cannot reference normative behavior"
  
  content_check:
    - "Final LPs MUST have reference implementation OR test vectors"
    - "Superseded LPs MUST reference replacement LP"
    - "No duplicate LP numbers allowed"
```

---

## Migration History

### v5.1 (Current)
- DAO (71xxx) → 2800-2849
- ESG (72xxx) → 2900-2999
- Removed 70000-79999 range

### v5.0
- Applied canonical renumbering
- ESG, DeFi, tokens moved to proper ranges
- See `docs/LP-RENUMBERING-DIFF.md`

---

## Backwards Compatibility

- Legacy LP numbers remain valid references
- Superseded LPs redirect to new numbers
- Old URLs 301-redirect to canonical locations

---

## Security Considerations

This is a meta/organizational proposal. No direct security impact.

Indirect impact: Clear LP organization prevents:
- Normative confusion (implementing research as spec)
- Scope creep (mixing domains)
- Governance attacks (hiding changes in wrong categories)
