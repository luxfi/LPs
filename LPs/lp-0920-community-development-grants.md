# LP-920: Community Development & Grants

## Abstract

This LP establishes the framework for Lux Network's community development and grants program. It defines funding categories, eligibility criteria, application processes, and impact measurement requirements for ecosystem grants.

## Motivation

Ecosystem development requires strategic capital deployment. Without a structured grants program:
1. **Funding decisions become ad hoc** - Lacking criteria leads to inconsistent outcomes
2. **Impact goes unmeasured** - No way to know if grants achieve intended goals
3. **Community trust erodes** - Opaque processes invite accusations of favoritism
4. **Resources scatter inefficiently** - Without strategy, grants fail to compound

This LP creates the framework for deploying ecosystem capital in ways that maximize positive impact while maintaining transparency and accountability.

## Program Overview

### Mission

Fund projects and initiatives that expand access to Lux Network, grow the developer ecosystem, and create positive social impact aligned with our Theory of Change.
