## Abstract

This LP defines the native tokens of the Lux Network, including the LUX currency, and outlines the tokenomics of the network. It also establishes a standardized identification system for the various chains within the Lux ecosystem.

## Native Token

The native token of the Lux Network is **LUX**.

### LUX Currency

LUX is the primary currency of the Lux Network and is used for:

*   **Staking**: Users can stake LUX to secure the network and earn rewards.
*   **Transaction Fees**: All transaction fees on the network are paid in LUX.
*   **Governance**: LUX holders can participate in the governance of the network.

### Tokenomics

*   **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 LUX
*   **Initial Distribution**:
    *   **Team**: 15%
    *   **Investors**: 20%
    *   **Ecosystem Fund**: 30%
    *   **Community**: 35%

## Chain Identification

The following single-character identifiers are assigned to the core chains of the Lux Network:

*   **P**: The Primary Network Chain.
*   **C**: The Contract Chain (C-Chain).
*   **X**: The Exchange Chain (X-Chain).
*   **M**: The MPC (Multi-Party Computation) Chain.
*   **Z**: The Z-Chain for privacy features.
*   **G**: The Graph Chain (G-Chain), a universal omnichain oracle.

## Reserved LPs for Chains

LP numbers 2 through 9 are reserved for future chain definitions.

*   **LP-2**: P-Chain
*   **LP-3**: C-Chain
*   **LP-4**: X-Chain
*   **LP-5**: M-Chain
*   **LP-6**: Z-Chain
*   **LP-7**: G-Chain
