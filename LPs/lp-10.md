## Abstract

This LIP specifies the Platform Chain, which is the metadata and coordination chain of Lux (analogous to Avalanche’s P-Chain). The LIP will detail the P-Chain’s responsibilities: coordinating validators and staking, tracking active subnets/chains, and allowing the creation of new blockchains.

## Motivation

A separate chain for platform metadata is beneficial to offload governance and coordination from the busy transaction chains.

## Specification

*(The spec will include the transaction types supported on P-Chain: e.g., adding a validator (staking transaction), creating a subnet (defining a new chain with certain VM), delegating stake, etc.)*

## Rationale

By reading this LIP, one learns about proof-of-stake validator logic (quorums, staking periods) and subnet management in a multi-chain environment.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LIP is foundational and does not introduce backwards compatibility issues.

## Security Considerations

Security considerations for the P-Chain include ensuring the integrity of validator staking and subnet creation operations.
