# LP-10001: Learning Path - Core Protocol

## Abstract

**"What is Lux, structurally and philosophically?"**

This is the foundational path. Everyone starts here regardless of role. It provides the mental model of the system.

## Motivation

Understanding core protocol fundamentals is prerequisite for all other learning paths. Without a solid mental model of network architecture, consensus, and chain relationships, advanced topics become disconnected facts rather than coherent knowledge.

## Audience

All roles: developers, validators, traders, investors, researchers.

## Outcome

After completing this path, you will understand:
- Network architecture and design principles
- Token economics and value flows
- System taxonomy and LP organization
- Consensus mechanism fundamentals
- Platform chain responsibilities

## Total Time

**~3 hours** for complete coverage.

---

## Completion Criteria

You should be able to answer:
1. What are the primary chains and their responsibilities?
2. How does consensus achieve finality?
3. What is the token economic model?
4. How are LPs organized in the taxonomy?
