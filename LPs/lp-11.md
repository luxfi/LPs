## Abstract

This LP details the Exchange Chain of Lux. The X-Chain is optimized for high-throughput transfer and creation of digital assets, and likely inherits the UTXO-based DAG design from Avalanche’s X-Chain.

## Motivation

The X-Chain is designed for high throughput and parallelism, making it ideal for asset transfers and settlement.

## Specification

*(This LP will specify how the X-Chain allows anyone to create new assets (tokens), send and receive them, and exchange them without a central order book.)*

## Rationale

By formalizing X-Chain, we ensure all aspects of asset issuance and decentralized exchange of tokens (in a broad sense) are documented for developers.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LP is foundational and does not introduce backwards compatibility issues.

## Security Considerations

Security considerations for the X-Chain include preventing double-spends and ensuring the integrity of asset creation and transfer operations.
