## Abstract

This LP defines the Contract Chain, which is Lux’s EVM-compatible smart contract chain (formerly LP-0003). The C-Chain runs an Ethereum Virtual Machine instance, enabling the deployment of Solidity (or Vyper) smart contracts.

## Motivation

By aligning with the EVM, Lux lowers the barrier for developers and fosters compatibility with existing Ethereum tools and infrastructure.

## Specification

*(This LP will detail how the C-Chain achieves total ordering of transactions and high fidelity to Ethereum’s semantics.)*

## Rationale

The educational side explains how aligning with EVM greatly lowers the barrier for developers and fosters compatibility.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LP is foundational and does not introduce backwards compatibility issues.

## Security Considerations

Security considerations for the C-Chain include ensuring the correctness of the EVM implementation and protecting against known smart contract vulnerabilities.
