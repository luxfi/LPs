## Abstract

This LP specifies the M-Chain, a new chain in Lux dedicated to bridging assets via MPC (Multi-Party Computation). (This was formerly LP-0004.) The M-Chainâ€™s role is to act as the coordination layer for cross-chain bridges, especially bridging between Lux and external networks (e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin) or between Lux subnets with different security domains.

## Motivation

The M-Chain provides a secure and decentralized way to bridge assets, addressing the security risks associated with centralized bridges.

## Specification

*(The LP will detail how the M-Chain leverages a network of bridge nodes that collectively hold cryptographic key shares to lock and mint assets (using threshold signatures).)*

## Rationale

The M-Chain spec is crucial given many high-profile bridge failures; by standardizing it with rigorous cryptography, Lux aims to be state-of-the-art in secure bridging.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LP is foundational and does not introduce backwards compatibility issues.

## Security Considerations

Security considerations for the M-Chain include the security of the MPC protocol, the management of key shares, and the prevention of collusion among bridge nodes.
