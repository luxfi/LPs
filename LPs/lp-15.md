## Abstract

This LP defines the overall Lux Bridge protocol using Multi-Party Computation/Threshold Signatures (see also M-Chain). This LP focuses on the cross-chain bridge processes themselves, abstracted from the specific M-Chain implementation.

## Motivation

A standardized MPC bridge protocol ensures that all assets bridged into the Lux ecosystem follow a secure, uniform protocol, reducing the risk of exploits.

## Specification

### Overview

The Lux MPC Bridge Protocol enables secure cross-chain asset transfers using threshold signatures. Bridge nodes collectively manage assets without any single party having full control.

### Key Components

1. **Bridge Nodes**: A set of n nodes where a threshold t (typically 2n/3 + 1) must cooperate to authorize transfers
2. **Asset Contracts**: Smart contracts on each chain that lock/unlock or mint/burn assets
3. **Message Relay**: Cross-chain message passing system for bridge operations
4. **Asset Registry**: On-chain registry tracking supported assets and their mappings (see LP-17)

### Bridge Operations

#### Peg-In (Source Chain → Lux)

1. **Initiation**: User calls `bridgeOut()` on source chain asset contract with:
   - Target chain ID
   - Recipient address
   - Amount
   - Optional metadata

2. **Asset Locking**: Source contract locks/escrows assets and emits `BridgeOutInitiated` event

3. **Event Observation**: Bridge nodes observe and verify the event independently

4. **Threshold Signing**: When t nodes agree on the event:
   - Generate threshold signature for mint authorization
   - Create cross-chain message (see LP-18 for format)

5. **Minting**: Target chain contract verifies threshold signature and mints wrapped assets

#### Peg-Out (Lux → Destination Chain)

1. **Burn Request**: User calls `bridgeIn()` burning wrapped assets
2. **Verification**: Bridge nodes verify burn transaction
3. **Release Authorization**: Threshold signature authorizes asset release
4. **Asset Release**: Original chain unlocks escrowed assets

### Threshold Signature Scheme

The protocol uses ECDSA threshold signatures (t-of-n) where:
- Key generation uses distributed key generation (DKG)
- No single party ever holds the complete private key
- Signing requires cooperation of at least t parties
- The public key remains constant even as signers change

### State Management

Bridge nodes maintain synchronized state including:
- Pending transfers
- Completed transfers (with proofs)
- Asset mappings and limits
- Node participation metrics

## Rationale

By standardizing the MPC bridge, Lux ensures that all assets bridged into its ecosystem follow a secure, uniform protocol, reducing the chance of the kinds of smart contract bugs or key compromises that have led to many bridge hacks.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LP is foundational and does not introduce backwards compatibility issues.

## Security Considerations

### Threshold Security
- **Honest Majority Assumption**: The protocol requires at least t honest nodes out of n total nodes
- **Key Compromise**: Individual key shares must be protected; compromise of fewer than t shares does not compromise the bridge
- **DKG Security**: The distributed key generation phase is critical and must be protected against adversarial manipulation

### Attack Vectors and Mitigations

1. **Collusion Attacks**
   - Risk: t or more malicious nodes could authorize fraudulent transfers
   - Mitigation: Node selection diversity, economic incentives, slashing mechanisms

2. **Eclipse Attacks**
   - Risk: Isolating honest nodes to prevent them from participating
   - Mitigation: Redundant network connections, peer diversity requirements

3. **Replay Attacks**
   - Risk: Reusing valid signatures for duplicate transfers
   - Mitigation: Nonces, chain-specific domains, transfer IDs

4. **Double-Spend Attempts**
   - Risk: Attempting to bridge the same assets multiple times
   - Mitigation: Strict ordering, finality requirements, state synchronization

### Operational Security

- **Node Requirements**: Minimum hardware specifications, network reliability, key management practices
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of bridge operations, anomaly detection
- **Emergency Procedures**: Pause mechanisms, threshold changes, key rotation protocols
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all bridge operations for forensic analysis

### Economic Security

- **Stake Requirements**: Nodes must stake LUX tokens as collateral
- **Slashing Conditions**: Malicious behavior results in stake slashing
- **Fee Distribution**: Incentive alignment through fee sharing among honest participants

### Cross-Chain Risks

- **Finality Differences**: Account for different finality guarantees across chains
- **Reorganization Handling**: Procedures for handling chain reorganizations
- **Gas/Fee Estimation**: Accurate fee estimation to prevent stuck transactions

## Test Cases

### Positive Test Cases

1. **Standard Transfer**
   - Lock 100 USDC on Ethereum
   - Verify wrapped USDC minted on Lux C-Chain
   - Burn wrapped USDC on Lux
   - Verify USDC unlocked on Ethereum

2. **Multi-Asset Bridge**
   - Bridge multiple assets in sequence
   - Verify correct mappings and amounts

3. **High-Value Transfer**
   - Test transfers above standard limits
   - Verify additional security checks engage

### Negative Test Cases

1. **Insufficient Signatures**
   - Attempt transfer with t-1 signatures
   - Verify rejection

2. **Invalid Asset**
   - Attempt to bridge unsupported asset
   - Verify proper error handling

3. **Replay Attack**
   - Attempt to reuse valid transfer proof
   - Verify rejection due to nonce

### Edge Cases

1. **Node Failure During Transfer**
   - Simulate node failures during signing
   - Verify recovery and completion

2. **Chain Reorganization**
   - Test handling of reorgs on source chain
   - Verify proper state reconciliation

3. **Gas Exhaustion**
   - Test low gas scenarios
   - Verify graceful handling and retry mechanisms
