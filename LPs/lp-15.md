## Abstract

This LIP defines the overall Lux Bridge protocol using Multi-Party Computation/Threshold Signatures (see also M-Chain). This LIP focuses on the cross-chain bridge processes themselves, abstracted from the specific M-Chain implementation.

## Motivation

A standardized MPC bridge protocol ensures that all assets bridged into the Lux ecosystem follow a secure, uniform protocol, reducing the risk of exploits.

## Specification

*(This LIP will describe the lifecycle of bridging an asset: peg-in (locking an asset on Chain A and minting on Chain B) and peg-out (burning on B to release on A).)*

## Rationale

By standardizing the MPC bridge, Lux ensures that all assets bridged into its ecosystem follow a secure, uniform protocol, reducing the chance of the kinds of smart contract bugs or key compromises that have led to many bridge hacks.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LIP is foundational and does not introduce backwards compatibility issues.

## Security Considerations

Security considerations for the MPC Bridge Protocol include the security of the threshold signature scheme, the prevention of collusion among bridge validators, and the robustness of the cross-chain message verification process.
