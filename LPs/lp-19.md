## Abstract

The Bridge Security Framework establishes comprehensive security standards and procedures for all cross-chain bridge operations within the Lux ecosystem. This LP defines security requirements for bridge implementations, monitoring systems, incident response procedures, and ongoing security maintenance. It applies to both the MPC Bridge (LP-15) and Teleport (LP-16) protocols, as well as future bridge implementations.

## Motivation

Bridge security is critical because bridges:

1. **Hold Significant Value**: Billions in assets flow through bridges
2. **Are Primary Attack Targets**: Most major DeFi hacks involve bridges
3. **Have Complex Attack Surfaces**: Multiple chains, validators, and protocols
4. **Require Coordinated Response**: Security incidents need rapid, organized action
5. **Need Continuous Monitoring**: Threats evolve and require ongoing vigilance

This framework ensures all Lux bridges maintain the highest security standards and can respond effectively to threats.

## Specification

### Security Architecture

#### Defense in Depth Model
```
Layer 1: Protocol Security
- Cryptographic primitives
- Consensus mechanisms
- Smart contract security

Layer 2: Operational Security  
- Key management
- Access controls
- Monitoring systems

Layer 3: Economic Security
- Stake requirements
- Insurance funds
- Slashing mechanisms

Layer 4: Governance Security
- Emergency procedures
- Upgrade processes
- Incident response
```

### Security Requirements

#### 1. Cryptographic Standards
```solidity
interface ICryptoStandards {
    // Minimum key sizes
    uint256 constant MIN_RSA_KEY_SIZE = 2048;
    uint256 constant MIN_ECDSA_KEY_SIZE = 256;
    
    // Approved algorithms
    enum HashAlgorithm { SHA256, SHA3_256, KECCAK256 }
    enum SignatureAlgorithm { ECDSA_SECP256K1, BLS12_381 }
    
    // Key rotation requirements
    uint256 constant MAX_KEY_AGE = 365 days;
    uint256 constant KEY_ROTATION_NOTICE = 30 days;
}
```

#### 2. Validator Security
```solidity
struct ValidatorRequirements {
    uint256 minStake;              // Minimum stake amount
    uint256 minUptime;             // Required uptime percentage
    bool hardwareSecurityModule;   // HSM requirement
    bool secureEnclave;            // TEE/SGX requirement
    uint256 slashingThreshold;     // Misbehavior threshold
}
```

#### 3. Smart Contract Security
- **Audit Requirements**: Two independent audits before mainnet
- **Formal Verification**: Critical functions must be formally verified
- **Upgrade Procedures**: Time-locked upgrades with governance approval
- **Emergency Pause**: Ability to halt operations within 15 minutes

### Monitoring and Detection

#### 1. Real-Time Monitoring
```solidity
interface IBridgeMonitor {
    struct MonitoringMetrics {
        uint256 totalValueLocked;
        uint256 dailyVolume;
        uint256 largestTransfer;
        uint256 failedTransactions;
        uint256 pendingTransactions;
        uint256 averageConfirmationTime;
    }
    
    function getMetrics() external view returns (MonitoringMetrics memory);
    function checkHealthStatus() external view returns (bool healthy, string memory issue);
}
```

#### 2. Anomaly Detection
```yaml
Detection Rules:
  - Unusual Volume: > 5x daily average
  - Large Transfer: > $10M single transaction
  - Rapid Withdrawals: > 10% TVL in 1 hour
  - Failed Transactions: > 5% failure rate
  - Validator Issues: < 80% participation
  - Gas Anomalies: > 3x normal gas usage
```

#### 3. Alert System
```solidity
enum AlertSeverity { INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL, EMERGENCY }

struct SecurityAlert {
    AlertSeverity severity;
    string alertType;
    bytes32 transactionHash;
    uint256 timestamp;
    string description;
    bytes additionalData;
}
```

### Incident Response

#### 1. Response Procedures
```
EMERGENCY RESPONSE FLOWCHART:

1. Detection (0-5 minutes)
   ├── Automated monitoring alert
   ├── Manual report
   └── On-chain anomaly

2. Assessment (5-15 minutes)
   ├── Verify incident
   ├── Determine severity
   └── Estimate impact

3. Containment (15-30 minutes)
   ├── Pause affected bridges
   ├── Freeze suspicious accounts
   └── Alert validators

4. Investigation (30-120 minutes)
   ├── Root cause analysis
   ├── Impact assessment
   └── Evidence collection

5. Recovery (2-24 hours)
   ├── Patch vulnerabilities
   ├── Restore operations
   └── Process refunds

6. Post-Mortem (24-72 hours)
   ├── Full incident report
   ├── Lessons learned
   └── Process improvements
```

#### 2. Emergency Roles
```solidity
contract EmergencyRoles {
    mapping(address => bool) public guardians;     // Can pause
    mapping(address => bool) public investigators; // Can freeze accounts
    mapping(address => bool) public operators;     // Can execute fixes
    
    uint256 constant GUARDIAN_THRESHOLD = 3;       // Multi-sig threshold
    uint256 constant PAUSE_DURATION = 24 hours;    // Max pause time
}
```

### Security Audits

#### 1. Audit Schedule
- **Pre-Launch**: Two full audits + formal verification
- **Quarterly**: Focused security review
- **Annual**: Comprehensive audit
- **Post-Incident**: Targeted audit after any security event

#### 2. Audit Scope
```yaml
Code Audit:
  - Smart contracts
  - Off-chain components
  - Key management systems
  - Monitoring infrastructure

Operational Audit:
  - Access controls
  - Incident procedures
  - Backup systems
  - Communication channels

Economic Audit:
  - Token economics
  - Fee structures
  - Insurance coverage
  - Slashing parameters
```

### Risk Management

#### 1. Risk Categories
```solidity
enum RiskCategory {
    CRYPTOGRAPHIC,    // Key compromise, algorithm weakness
    OPERATIONAL,      // Human error, system failure
    ECONOMIC,         // Market manipulation, fee exploitation
    GOVERNANCE,       // Malicious proposals, voting attacks
    EXTERNAL          // Chain vulnerabilities, oracle failures
}
```

#### 2. Risk Mitigation
```yaml
Cryptographic Risks:
  - Multi-party computation
  - Key rotation policies
  - Hardware security modules
  
Operational Risks:
  - Redundant systems
  - Automated failovers
  - Regular drills

Economic Risks:
  - Dynamic fee adjustment
  - Transfer limits
  - Insurance fund

Governance Risks:
  - Time locks
  - Multi-sig controls
  - Stake requirements

External Risks:
  - Oracle diversity
  - Chain monitoring
  - Fallback mechanisms
```

### Insurance and Recovery

#### 1. Insurance Fund
```solidity
contract BridgeInsurance {
    uint256 public fundTarget;      // Target insurance amount
    uint256 public fundBalance;     // Current balance
    
    struct Claim {
        address claimant;
        uint256 amount;
        bytes32 incidentId;
        ClaimStatus status;
    }
    
    function fileClaim(uint256 amount, bytes32 incidentId) external;
    function processClaim(uint256 claimId) external onlyGovernance;
}
```

#### 2. Recovery Procedures
- **Asset Recovery**: Procedures for recovering stolen/stuck funds
- **State Recovery**: Rebuilding state from backups
- **Communication**: User notification protocols

## Rationale

### Design Philosophy
1. **Prevention First**: Focus on preventing incidents rather than just responding
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
3. **Rapid Response**: Minimize damage through quick action
4. **Transparency**: Open communication about security matters
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from incidents and near-misses

### Key Trade-offs
- **Security vs Speed**: Prioritize security over transaction speed
- **Decentralization vs Control**: Balance with emergency powers
- **Transparency vs OpSec**: Share info while protecting sensitive details

## Backwards Compatibility

This security framework is designed to be applied to existing bridges:
1. Current bridges can adopt incrementally
2. Core security features are mandatory
3. Advanced features can be phased in

## Test Cases

### Security Drills
1. **Emergency Pause Drill**
   - Simulate critical vulnerability
   - Test pause mechanism
   - Verify < 15 minute response

2. **Key Compromise Drill**

   - Test key rotation
   - Verify no fund loss

3. **Economic Attack Simulation**
   - Test against flash loan attacks
   - Verify fee manipulation resistance
   - Check oracle manipulation defenses

### Monitoring Tests
1. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Generate abnormal patterns
   - Verify detection accuracy
   - Test alert routing

2. **Incident Response**
   - Full incident simulation
   - Test each response phase
   - Measure response times
