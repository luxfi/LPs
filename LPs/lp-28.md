## Abstract

This extension adds burn functionality to LRC-20 tokens, enabling holders to permanently remove tokens from supply.

## Motivation

Standard LRC-20 tokens provide basic minting and transfer operations. Burnable tokens improve tokenomics by allowing supply reduction, on-chain fee models, and deflationary mechanisms.

## Specification

### Interface

```solidity
interface IERC20Burnable {
    /**
     * @dev Emitted when `value` tokens are burned from `account`.
     */
    event Burn(address indexed account, uint256 value);

    /**
     * @dev Destroys `amount` tokens from the caller, reducing total supply.
     * 
     * Emits a {Transfer} event with `to` set to the zero address.
     * Emits a {Burn} event.
     *
     * Requirements:
     * - `amount` must not exceed the caller's balance.
     */
    function burn(uint256 amount) external;

    /**
     * @dev Destroys `amount` tokens from `account`, deducting from the caller's allowance.
     *
     * Emits a {Transfer} event with `to` set to the zero address.
     * Emits a {Burn} event.
     * Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.
     *
     * Requirements:
     * - `account` must have approved the caller for at least `amount` tokens.
     * - `amount` must not exceed `account`'s balance.
     */
    function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) external;
}
```

### Implementation Notes

1. **Event Emission**: Both `Transfer(account, address(0), amount)` and `Burn(account, amount)` events should be emitted for transparency and compatibility with existing tools.

2. **Total Supply**: The `totalSupply()` function must be decreased by the burned amount.

3. **Error Handling**: Use descriptive revert messages:
   ```solidity
   require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount, "ERC20: burn amount exceeds balance");
   ```

## Rationale

Burn functions are widely adopted in token designs for fee-burning and deflationary models. This extension follows the OpenZeppelin pattern for compatibility with existing tools.

## Backwards Compatibility

This is a backwards-compatible extension. Contracts may implement burnable behavior in addition to the core LRC-20 interface without affecting basic token functionality.

## Test Cases

### Burn Function Tests
1. **Successful Burn**
   ```javascript
   // Initial: balance = 1000, totalSupply = 10000
   burn(100)
   // Result: balance = 900, totalSupply = 9900
   // Events: Transfer(user, 0x0, 100), Burn(user, 100)
   ```

2. **Burn Exceeds Balance**
   ```javascript
   // Balance = 100
   burn(200) // Should revert: "ERC20: burn amount exceeds balance"
   ```

3. **Burn Zero Amount**
   ```javascript
   burn(0) // Should succeed with no state changes
   ```

### BurnFrom Function Tests
1. **Successful BurnFrom**
   ```javascript
   // Alice approves Bob for 500
   // Alice balance = 1000
   burnFrom(alice, 200) // Called by Bob
   // Result: Alice balance = 800, Bob's allowance = 300
   ```

2. **BurnFrom Exceeds Allowance**
   ```javascript
   // Allowance = 100
   burnFrom(alice, 200) // Should revert: "ERC20: insufficient allowance"
   ```

3. **BurnFrom with Max Allowance**
   ```javascript
   // Allowance = type(uint256).max
   burnFrom(alice, 100)
   // Allowance should remain at max (no decrement)
   ```

## Reference Implementation

### Interface
See the IERC20Burnable interface in the standard repository:
```text
/standard/src/interfaces/IERC20Burnable.sol
```

### Example Implementation
```solidity
contract BurnableToken is ERC20, IERC20Burnable {
    function burn(uint256 amount) external override {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }
    
    function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) external override {
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance[account][msg.sender];
        require(currentAllowance >= amount, "ERC20: insufficient allowance");
        
        // Update allowance if not max
        if (currentAllowance != type(uint256).max) {
            _approve(account, msg.sender, currentAllowance - amount);
        }
        
        _burn(account, amount);
    }
    
    function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal {
        require(account != address(0), "ERC20: burn from zero address");
        require(balanceOf[account] >= amount, "ERC20: burn amount exceeds balance");
        
        balanceOf[account] -= amount;
        totalSupply -= amount;
        
        emit Transfer(account, address(0), amount);
        emit Burn(account, amount);
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

- Ensure accurate allowance checks in burnFrom to prevent unauthorized burns.
- Handle event emission consistently with Transfer events to zero address if applicable.
