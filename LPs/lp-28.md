## Abstract

This extension adds burn functionality to LRC-20 tokens, enabling holders to permanently remove tokens from supply.

## Motivation

Standard LRC-20 tokens provide basic minting and transfer operations. Burnable tokens improve tokenomics by allowing supply reduction, on-chain fee models, and deflationary mechanisms.

## Specification

```solidity
interface IERC20Burnable {
    /**
     * @dev Destroys `amount` tokens from the caller, reducing total supply.
     */
    function burn(uint256 amount) external;

    /**
     * @dev Destroys `amount` tokens from `account`, deducting from the caller's allowance.
     */
    function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) external;
}
```

## Rationale

Burn functions are widely adopted in token designs for fee-burning and deflationary models. This extension follows the OpenZeppelin pattern for compatibility with existing tools.

## Backwards Compatibility

This is a backwards-compatible extension. Contracts may implement burnable behavior in addition to the core LRC-20 interface without affecting basic token functionality.

## Test Cases

Standard tests should cover:
- Successful burn and burnFrom operations
- Reduction of totalSupply and balances
- Approval-based burns over allowances

## Reference Implementation

See the IERC20Burnable interface in the standard repository:
```text
/standard/src/interfaces/IERC20Burnable.sol
```

## Security Considerations

- Ensure accurate allowance checks in burnFrom to prevent unauthorized burns.
- Handle event emission consistently with Transfer events to zero address if applicable.
