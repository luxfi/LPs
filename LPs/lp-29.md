## Abstract

This extension adds minting capability to LRC-20 tokens, enabling designated accounts to generate new tokens within defined constraints.

## Motivation

Mintable tokens are essential for protocols requiring dynamic supply management, such as stablecoins, reward distributions, and governance tokens.

## Specification

```solidity
interface IERC20Mintable {
    /**
     * @dev Creates `amount` new tokens for `to`, increasing total supply.
     */
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external;
}
```

## Rationale

Token minting is a core extension for applications needing controlled supply issuance. This interface aligns with the common OpenZeppelin pattern for mintable tokens.

## Backwards Compatibility

This is a backwards-compatible, additive extension to LRC-20. Core token operations remain unaffected.

## Test Cases

Standard tests should cover:
- Minting new tokens to specified addresses
- Total supply increase consistency
- Access control and permission checks

## Reference Implementation

See the IERC20Mintable interface in the standard repository:

/standard/src/interfaces/IERC20Mintable.sol
```

## Security Considerations

- Restrict minting to authorized roles to prevent inflation attacks.
- Implement supply caps or governance checks as needed.
