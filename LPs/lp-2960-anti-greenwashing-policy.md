# LP-840: Impact Disclosure & Anti-Greenwashing Policy

## Abstract

This LP establishes the standards and processes for making sustainability and impact claims. It ensures all environmental and social claims made by Lux Network are accurate, verifiable, and not misleading. This policy prevents greenwashing and maintains stakeholder trust.

## Motivation

Greenwashing has become rampant in the blockchain industry, eroding stakeholder trust. Lux Network must:
1. **Maintain credibility** by backing every claim with evidence
2. **Avoid regulatory action** as greenwashing regulations tighten globally
3. **Protect stakeholders** from making decisions based on misleading information
4. **Set industry standards** by demonstrating what responsible claims look like

This LP creates the internal controls necessary to ensure that Lux Network's sustainability communications are always accurate, complete, and verifiable. It protects both stakeholders and the network's reputation.

## Definitions

**Greenwashing**: Making misleading, unsubstantiated, or exaggerated claims about environmental or social benefits.

**Material Claim**: A sustainability statement that could influence stakeholder decisions.

**Substantiated Claim**: A claim backed by verifiable evidence and sound methodology.

## Core Principles

1. **Accuracy**: Claims must be factually correct
2. **Completeness**: Don't cherry-pick favorable data
3. **Clarity**: Use plain language, avoid jargon
4. **Comparability**: Provide context for metrics
5. **Currency**: Use up-to-date information
6. **Verifiability**: Claims must be auditable

## Claim Categories

### Permitted Claims

| Claim Type | Requirements | Example |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Quantified** | Specific numbers with methodology | "Network uses 65% renewable energy" |
| **Comparative** | Fair comparison, same methodology | "50% more efficient than 2023" |
| **Directional** | Clear trend with data | "Emissions decreasing year-over-year" |
| **Certified** | Third-party verification | "ISO 14001 certified operations" |

### Prohibited Claims

| Claim Type | Problem | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Vague** | No specific meaning | "Eco-friendly blockchain" |
| **Unsubstantiated** | No evidence | "Zero environmental impact" |
| **Misleading comparison** | Unfair baseline | "99% more efficient than Bitcoin" (without context) |
| **Future-as-present** | Aspirational as achieved | "Carbon neutral network" (before achieved) |
| **Irrelevant** | True but misleading | "No coal mining" (we never mined) |

## Claim Verification Process

### Pre-Publication Review

**Required for all material sustainability claims**:

1. **Draft claim**: Author prepares claim with supporting data
2. **Data verification**: Sustainability team verifies underlying data
3. **Methodology check**: Confirm calculation methodology
4. **Legal review**: For significant claims (>$1M impact or prominent placement)
5. **Approval**: Sign-off by Sustainability Lead

### Review Criteria

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Truthful** | Is the claim factually accurate? |
| **Clear** | Will average reader understand correctly? |
| **Complete** | Are important caveats included? |
| **Current** | Is the data recent enough? |
| **Substantiated** | Can we provide evidence if challenged? |
| **Contextual** | Is appropriate context provided? |

### Approval Authority

| Claim Prominence | Approver |
|------------------|----------|
| Website/marketing | Communications + Sustainability Lead |
| Press releases | Communications + Legal + ESG Committee |
| Regulatory filings | Legal + ESG Committee |
| Annual report | ESG Committee + Board review |

## Language Standards

### Required Qualifiers

| Situation | Required Qualifier |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Estimates | "Estimated", "approximately" |
| Partial data | "Based on X% of validators" |
| Projections | "Target", "goal", "projected" |
| Self-reported | "Self-reported by validators" |
| Third-party data | Source attribution |

### Recommended Phrasing

**Instead of**: "We are carbon neutral"
**Use**: "We offset 100% of estimated Scope 2 emissions through verified carbon credits"

**Instead of**: "Green blockchain"
**Use**: "65% of our validator network runs on renewable energy"

**Instead of**: "Sustainable by design"
**Use**: "Our proof-of-stake consensus uses 99.9% less energy than proof-of-work"

### Prohibited Terms (Without Substantiation)

- "Sustainable" (without specific context)
- "Green" (without specific context)
- "Eco-friendly"
- "Carbon neutral" / "Net zero" (before verified achievement)
- "Clean" energy (without renewable %)
- "Zero impact"

## Data Standards

### Data Quality Requirements

| Claim Type | Minimum Data Quality |
|------------|----------------------|
| Quantified claims | Primary data or verified secondary |
| Trend claims | ≥3 data points, consistent methodology |
| Comparative claims | Same methodology, same time period |
| Third-party claims | Verification documentation |

### Data Currency

| Data Type | Maximum Age |
|-----------|-------------|
| Real-time metrics | Current |
| Quarterly reports | <6 months |
| Annual reports | <18 months |
| Methodologies | Current (update on change) |

### Uncertainty Disclosure

For estimates and projections:
- State confidence level or range
- Explain key assumptions
- Note limitations

**Example**: "Network energy consumption is estimated at 1.3 GWh annually (±20%), based on validator survey data covering 65% of stake."

## Comparative Claims

### Fair Comparison Requirements

1. **Same scope**: Compare equivalent metrics
2. **Same methodology**: Use consistent calculations
3. **Same time period**: Compare same dates/periods
4. **Provide context**: Explain what's being compared
5. **Acknowledge limitations**: Note methodology differences

### Network Comparisons

When comparing to other blockchain networks:

**Required**:
- Note consensus mechanism differences
- Use finality-adjusted metrics
- Cite data sources
- Acknowledge methodology limitations

**Example**: "Lux uses approximately 0.02 Wh per final transaction, compared to Bitcoin's estimated 700,000 Wh per final transaction (sources: [Lux methodology], [CBECI]). Note: Different consensus mechanisms make direct comparison imperfect."

## Offset & Credit Claims

### Carbon Offset Claims

| Claim | Requirements |
|-------|--------------|
| "Offset X tonnes" | Registry documentation, retirement proof |
| "Carbon neutral" | 100% of calculated emissions offset, third-party verification |
| "Net zero" | Reduction pathway + residual offsets, SBTi-aligned |

### Renewable Energy Claims

| Claim | Requirements |
|-------|--------------|
| "X% renewable" | REC/GO certificates OR direct measurement |
| "100% renewable" | Full coverage with certificates, third-party verification |
| "Powered by renewable energy" | Majority (>50%) renewable + disclosed |

### Credit Quality Standards

Only claim credits that are:
- **Additional**: Would not have happened without the credit
- **Verified**: By recognized standard (Gold Standard, Verra VCS)
- **Permanent**: Long-term carbon storage (for removals)
- **Not double-counted**: Exclusive claim rights

## Correction & Retraction

### Error Discovery

When an error in sustainability claims is discovered:

1. **Assess materiality**: Determine impact on stakeholder decisions
2. **Correct promptly**: Update incorrect information
3. **Disclose correction**: Publish correction notice
4. **Explain impact**: Quantify effect of error
5. **Prevent recurrence**: Update processes

### Correction Notice Requirements

| Error Type | Correction Action |
|------------|-------------------|
| Minor (typo, rounding) | Silent correction, note in next report |
| Moderate (metric error) | Correction notice, update all instances |
| Material (significant misstatement) | Public correction, stakeholder notification |

### Retraction

If a claim cannot be substantiated:
1. Remove claim from all materials
2. Issue retraction statement
3. Explain why claim was made
4. Describe prevention measures

## Training & Compliance

### Required Training

| Role | Training Requirement |
|------|----------------------|
| Communications team | Annual greenwashing prevention |
| Marketing team | Annual claim verification |
| Executive team | ESG claims awareness |
| All employees | Basic sustainability communications |

- Regulatory update tracking

## External Claims

### Ecosystem Project Claims

Projects in the Lux ecosystem making sustainability claims must:
