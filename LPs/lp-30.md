## Abstract

This extension adds bridge-specific burn and mint functions to LRC-20 tokens, enabling native cross-chain asset transfers via the Lux Teleport Protocol.

## Motivation

Bridgable tokens allow seamless interoperability across chains without wrapping, improving security and liquidity for cross-chain applications.

## Specification

```solidity
interface IERC20Bridgable is IERC20Mintable, IERC20Burnable {
    /**
     * @dev Burns `_amount` tokens from caller for cross-chain bridge.
     */
    function bridgeBurn(address to, uint256 amount) external;

    /**
     * @dev Mints `_amount` bridged tokens to `_from` upon cross-chain arrival.
     */
    function bridgeMint(address from, uint256 amount) external;
}
```

## Rationale

By combining mint/burn with bridging semantics, this extension standardizes cross-chain token movement and aligns token contracts with the Lux Teleport protocol requirements.

## Backwards Compatibility

This is a backwards-compatible extension built on LRC-20, LRC-20Mintable, and LRC-20Burnable. Core token functionality remains intact.

## Test Cases

Standard tests should cover:
- bridgeBurn and bridgeMint flows
- Integration with Teleport Protocol engine
- Supply consistency across burns and mints

## Reference Implementation

See the IERC20Bridgable interface in the standard repository:

/standard/src/interfaces/IERC20Bridgable.sol
```

## Security Considerations

- Ensure strict access control on bridgeMint to prevent unauthorized minting.
- Validate correct burn amounts and cross-chain message proofs.
