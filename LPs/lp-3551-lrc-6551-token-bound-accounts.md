## Abstract
LRC-6551 (mirrors ERC-6551) enables NFTs to own assets as smart contract wallets.

## Specification
Every NFT gets a deterministic smart contract account that can hold assets.


## Motivation

This standard ensures compatibility with the broader EVM ecosystem while enabling Lux-specific optimizations.

## Rationale

Mirrors the corresponding Ethereum standard for maximum compatibility.

## Backwards Compatibility

Fully compatible with existing ERC implementations.

## Security Considerations

Implementations should follow established security best practices for the corresponding ERC.
