## Abstract
LRC-6909 (mirrors ERC-6909) provides a gas-efficient minimal multi-token interface.

## Specification
Simplified multi-token standard with reduced gas costs compared to LRC-1155.


## Motivation

This standard ensures compatibility with the broader EVM ecosystem while enabling Lux-specific optimizations.

## Rationale

Mirrors the corresponding Ethereum standard for maximum compatibility.

## Backwards Compatibility

Fully compatible with existing ERC implementations.

## Security Considerations

Implementations should follow established security best practices for the corresponding ERC.
