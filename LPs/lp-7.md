## Abstract

This LIP defines the Virtual Machine SDK for Lux (in the vmsdk repo), which allows developers to create new blockchain VMs that run on Lux subnets.

## Specification

*(This LIP will specify the interface a VM must implement (for example, methods for block validation, state management, and consensus hooks), enabling it to integrate with the consensus layer.)*

## Rationale

By providing an SDK spec, Lux invites innovation: teams could develop specialized chains (subnets) for particular use cases, all while conforming to a common framework.
