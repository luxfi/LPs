# LP-860: Evidence Locker Index

## Abstract

This LP serves as the centralized index for all ESG-related evidence artifacts maintained by Lux Network. It catalogs policies, methodologies, reports, attestations, and audit results that support claims made in LP-800 and related ESG proposals. This is the "credibility engine" that makes our ESG framework auditable and verifiable.

## Motivation

ESG claims without accessible evidence are unverifiable. Stakeholders require:
1. **Centralized access** - One place to find all supporting documentation
2. **Version control** - Clear audit trails for evolving policies
3. **Third-party verification** - External attestations for critical claims
4. **Completeness tracking** - Visibility into documentation gaps

This LP creates the organizational infrastructure that transforms ESG claims into verifiable facts. It is the foundation of trust that enables institutional engagement and regulatory compliance.

## Purpose

To be credible to institutional stakeholders (banks, LPs, partners), we must provide:
1. **Accessible evidence**: Organized, findable documentation
2. **Version control**: Clear audit trails
3. **External verification**: Third-party attestations
4. **Completeness**: All material topics covered

This index serves as the single entry point for all ESG evidence.
