# LP-900: Impact Framework & Theory of Change

## Abstract

This LP establishes the foundational framework for Lux Network's social impact strategy. It defines our Theory of Change, impact objectives, measurement approach, and reporting commitments. This framework guides all social impact initiatives and ensures they align with our mission to create equitable, accessible financial infrastructure.

## Motivation

Blockchain technology promises to democratize finance, yet most networks lack clear frameworks for measuring whether they deliver on that promise. Without a Theory of Change:
1. **Impact claims remain vague** - "Financial inclusion" means nothing without measurable outcomes
2. **Resource allocation lacks direction** - Grants and development efforts scatter without strategy
3. **Accountability gaps emerge** - No way to verify if the network creates actual social benefit
4. **Stakeholder trust erodes** - Communities cannot assess whether the network serves their interests

This LP provides the strategic foundation for translating Lux Network's mission into measurable social outcomes aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals.

## Theory of Change

### Vision

A world where financial infrastructure is accessible, transparent, and empowering for all participants, regardless of geography, economic status, or technical sophistication.

### Mission

Build blockchain infrastructure that democratizes access to financial services, enables transparent and creates measurable positive outcomes for communities worldwide.

### Theory of Change Model

## Impact Measurement Approach

### Framework

Aligned with **IRIS+ Catalog** and **IMP Five Dimensions of Impact**:

#### Five Dimensions

1. **What**: What outcomes occur?
2. **Who**: Who experiences the outcome?
3. **How Much**: How much change occurs?
4. **Contribution**: What is our contribution to the change?
5. **Risk**: What is the risk that impact doesn't occur?

### Metrics Hierarchy

| Level | Type | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Impact** | Long-term change | Lives improved |
| **Outcome** | Behavior change | Users accessing services |
| **Output** | Deliverables | Transactions processed |
| **Activity** | Actions taken | Features developed |
| **Input** | Resources invested | Capital deployed |

### Data Collection

| Data Type | Method | Frequency |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
