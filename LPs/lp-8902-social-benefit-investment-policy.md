# LP-752: Social Benefit Investment Policy

## Abstract

Lux Vision Fund treats social benefit as the creation of real economic mobility—jobs, skills, income stability, access, and safety—paired with protections against exploitation. We invest in projects that create meaningful opportunity and build resilience for people and communities.

**Principle**: Opportunity, dignity, and resilience.

## Motivation

Social impact claims are frequently superficial—counting jobs created without assessing quality, or claiming "financial inclusion" while enabling predatory lending. Traditional impact metrics often miss exploitation, precarity, and the lack of real economic mobility.

This policy establishes:
1. **Quality over quantity** - Living wages and durable skills, not just job counts
2. **Protection against exploitation** - Explicit anti-exploitation requirements
3. **Economic mobility** - Measurable pathways to financial stability
4. **Community resilience** - Building long-term capacity, not dependency

## What Qualifies as "S-Aligned"
