## Abstract

This LP defines the official Command-Line Interface (CLI) tools for Lux (for the cli repo). This LP enumerates the standard commands, options, and JSON outputs for the lux-cli (and related tools), ensuring a uniform experience for users and scripts.

## Specification

*(This LP will include sections for each major command group: managing keys and wallets, issuing transactions on various chains, node administration, network deployment (interfacing with LP-6’s testnet framework), etc.)*

## Rationale

By standardizing the CLI, all users from developers to validators have a clear reference on interacting with Lux, and it aids in writing documentation and tutorials consistent with the tool’s behavior.
