## Abstract

The Luxfi ecosystem requires a unified graph database and GraphQL query engine natively integrated with its Avalanche-based network (covering C-Chain, P-Chain, and X-Chain). This LP defines a modular Go-based solution consisting of:
- a high-performance, deterministic graph storage engine (luxfi/graphdb) built on tuned Badger-Plus;
- a custom GraphVM interpreter (luxfi/graphql) that compiles GraphQL queries into Solidity-compatible bytecode with gas metering; and
- a suite of EVM precompiles (luxfi/precompiles at 0x0B–0x11) for graph mutations and cross-chain proof verification.

By embedding GraphQL querying and on-chain-compatible graph operations directly into the node (luxd), Luxfi enables rich, performant queries and trust-minimized graph updates—offering full on-chain interoperability akin to external indexers like The Graph, but built into the protocol itself.

## Motivation

Blockchain dApps and infrastructure need fast, expressive access to cross-chain state (assets, addresses, validators, transactions, subnets, etc.). External indexers introduce trust assumptions, latency, and version skew. On-chain contracts cannot efficiently traverse large graphs in Solidity. This LP solves both problems by:

1. Providing a deterministic, high-performance GraphDB backend that scales to chain-wide data.
2. Exposing a GraphQL interface for rich off-chain queries and a GraphVM for on-chain–compatible query execution.
3. Leveraging EVM precompiles to mutate and verify graph data atomically within consensus.

This approach ensures every node maintains the same graph state, allows trust-minimized cross-chain proofs, and dramatically simplifies application logic by unifying chain data under a single, protocol‑native graph API.

## Specification

### 1. GraphDB Backend (luxfi/graphdb)

- **Badger-Plus with O_DIRECT WAL**: Uses direct I/O for the write-ahead log to bypass kernel buffering, yielding predictable latency under high throughput.
- **Deterministic SST and Compaction**: Disables non‑essential background compaction during block processing; enforces synchronized compaction schedules and deterministic SSTable generation to keep all nodes in lockstep.
- **Optimized Key-Value Model**: Stores nodes as `Node:<type>:<id>` and edges as `Edge:<src_type>:<src_id>:<relation>:<dst_type>:<dst_id>`, sharding adjacency lists into multiple keys and utilizing streaming prefix scans for high-throughput traversal.
- **Batch Write Interface**: Supports bulk ingestion with batched transactions and controlled compactions for fast initial sync and large historical backfills.

### 2. GraphVM Interpreter (luxfi/graphql)

- **Bytecode Compilation**: Parses incoming GraphQL queries into a Solidity‑compatible bytecode instruction set, enabling on-chain execution paths.
- **Gas‑Metered Execution**: Executes query bytecode with fine‑grained gas costs per opcode (e.g. edge iteration, filters, aggregations) to enforce EVM block gas limits.
- **Solidity‑Compatible ABI**: Defines query bytecode and data structures (256‑bit words, bytes arrays) so that contracts can store and invoke pre-compiled queries as calls to precompiles.
- **Query Semantics**: Supports GraphQL read queries natively and optional write mutations via separate instructions; result sets are serialized to JSON (for off‑chain) or packed for contract return values.

### 3. EVM Precompiles (luxfi/precompiles at 0x0B–0x11)

- **Mutation Precompiles (0x0B–0x10)**: On-chain transactions can call precompiles to add/update graph nodes and edges, atomically updating Badger-Plus and the Verkle trie within block processing. Gas costs reflect data size and complexity.
- **Proof Verifier Precompile (0x11)**: Verifies Merkle/Verkle/light-client proofs for cross-chain data before graph ingestion, mirroring Avalanche Warp Messaging patterns. Valid proofs trigger corresponding graph mutations.

### 4. Node Integration

- **C‑Chain Hooks**: Registers graph precompiles via AvalancheGo config; precompiles have read‑write access to the GraphDB instance.
- **P‑Chain and X‑Chain Hooks**: Implements deterministic block event listeners that update the graph (e.g. new subnets, UTXO events) by calling graphdb APIs directly during block processing.
- **State Commitments**: Maintains a Verkle trie commitment to the graph state; the current root is published in block metadata to enable succinct on‑chain proofs and light‑client verification.

## Rationale

Splitting responsibilities into graphdb, graphql, and precompiles isolates concerns, simplifies testing, and enables independent evolution (e.g. alternate backends or query engines). Badger-Plus tuning ensures high write/read performance and deterministic state across nodes. A standalone GraphVM with Solidity‑aligned bytecode makes on-chain graph queries feasible, avoiding the prohibitive gas costs of pure EVM loops. Precompiles integrate graph operations seamlessly into consensus, maintaining atomicity and determinism.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LP adds new precompiles (0x0B–0x11) and node hooks; it does not break existing APIs or state. Nodes without this LP will ignore graph calls, and contracts cannot invoke unknown precompiles, resulting in fallback behaviors. Clients should upgrade before relying on graph features.

## Test Cases

- Unit tests for Badger-Plus determinism, batch ingestion, and Verkle trie updates in luxfi/graphdb.
- GraphVM opcode tests with gas accounting and expected results in luxfi/graphql.
- Precompile integration tests simulating EVM calls to 0x0B–0x11, state changes, and proof verification.
- End‑to‑end tests: JSON‑RPC/GraphQL query responses and contract calls to precompiles on a testnet.

## Reference Implementation

Reference code is available in three Go modules:

- https://github.com/luxfi/graphdb
- https://github.com/luxfi/graphql
- https://github.com/luxfi/precompiles

## Security Considerations

Graph data exposes rich on-chain relationships; access controls and gas metering prevent DoS via expensive queries. Proof verification requires accurate light-client state; nodes must keep proof roots synchronized. Deterministic storage tuning avoids fork divergence. Any cryptographic commitment scheme (Merkle, Verkle) must undergo independent audit.

## Economic Impact

GraphVM query gas costs and precompile storage writes introduce new gas sinks; these must be calibrated to balance usability and anti‑spam. Bulk ingestion occurs off‑chain at node startup (no on-chain fees). Incentives for data integrity rely on validator uptime and node operators maintaining graph commitments.

## Open Questions

- Should mutation precompiles support batch inserts within a single call?
- What guardrails (whitelists, ACLs) are needed for schema evolution or custom GraphQL extensions?
- How to best surface proof root updates to light clients (block metadata vs. separate registry)?
