# Lux Proposals (LPs)

Lux Proposals (LPs) are the primary mechanism for proposing new features, gathering community input, and documenting design decisions for the [Lux Network](https://lux.network). This process ensures that changes to the network are transparently reviewed and achieve community consensus before implementation ‚Äì much like Bitcoin‚Äôs BIPs and Ethereum‚Äôs EIPs, which allow anyone to propose and debate protocol improvements Ôøº Ôøº.

## What is an LP?

A Lux Proposal (LP) is a design document that provides information to the Lux community about a proposed change to the system. LPs serve as the formal pathway to introduce improvements and build agreement on their adoption. They are used for:
	‚Ä¢	Proposing new features or standards ‚Äì outlining technical specs for enhancements.
	‚Ä¢	Collecting community input ‚Äì soliciting feedback and technical review from the community.
	‚Ä¢	Documenting design decisions ‚Äì recording the rationale behind changes.

By using LPs, the Lux community can coordinate development in a decentralized manner, similar to the improvement proposal frameworks of other blockchains Ôøº. Every network upgrade or standard in Lux originates from an LP, ensuring an open governance process.

## Quick Start
	‚Ä¢	üìñ New to LPs? Begin with LP-0, which provides an overview of the Lux Network architecture and the community contribution framework.
	‚Ä¢	üöÄ Create a new LP: Use the provided template by running make new (this invokes the ./scripts/new-lp.sh script) to scaffold a proposal draft.
	‚Ä¢	üìã View all LPs: See INDEX.md for a complete list of proposals and their details.
	‚Ä¢	üîç Check status: See STATUS.md for the current status of each LP (Draft, Final, etc.).

## LP Process

To ensure each proposal is thoroughly vetted and agreed upon, Lux Proposals follow a structured process:
	1.	üí° Have an idea ‚Äì Begin by discussing your idea with the community (for example, on the Lux forum). Early discussion helps refine the idea and gauge community interest, much like how Bitcoin proposals start on mailing lists before formalization Ôøº.
	2.	üìù Draft your LP ‚Äì Using the template provided (via make new), write a draft of the proposal. This draft should clearly outline the problem, the proposed solution, and technical details.
	3.	üîÑ Submit a Pull Request ‚Äì Submit your LP as a pull request to the luxfi/LPs repository. The pull request number will be assigned as the official LP number.
	4.	üë• Get reviewed ‚Äì The LP editors (maintainers of the proposals repository) will review the draft for completeness, correct formatting, and adherence to the guidelines. They may request changes or improvements before acceptance.
	5.	ü§ù Build consensus ‚Äì Once the draft is published, the wider community discusses the proposal (on forums, Discord, GitHub discussions, etc.). Feedback is incorporated by the author to address concerns and build rough consensus that the change is worthwhile.
	6.	‚è∞ Last Call ‚Äì After consensus emerges, the proposal enters a Last Call status, a final 14-day review period Ôøº. This gives any remaining stakeholders a chance to raise objections or point out issues. If no major issues arise during this time, the proposal moves forward.
	7.	‚úÖ Final ‚Äì With successful completion of Last Call, the LP is marked Final. A Final LP signifies the proposal is accepted as a standard and is ready for implementation. At this stage, it should only be updated for minor corrections or clarifications. Implementation (in client code, smart contracts, etc.) can proceed, and the changes defined by the LP become part of the Lux Network.

Throughout this process, the goal is to emulate the best practices of open governance in blockchain communities: transparent discussion, iterative improvement, and broad consensus Ôøº Ôøº. Just as Ethereum‚Äôs core updates consist of sets of EIPs that clients must implement to stay in consensus Ôøº, Lux uses LPs to coordinate network upgrades and standards.

## Types of LPs

Not all proposals are alike. Lux Proposals are categorized by their purpose and scope, similar to the categorization in Ethereum‚Äôs EIP process Ôøº:
	‚Ä¢	Standards Track: Proposals that involve technical changes affecting the Lux protocol or network on a broad scale. These include:
	‚Ä¢	Core: Changes to core consensus or network rules (e.g. consensus algorithm modifications or upgrades that require coordination across all nodes).
	‚Ä¢	Networking: Improvements to peer-to-peer networking, communication protocols, or other network-layer changes.
	‚Ä¢	Interface: Specifications for client APIs, RPC interfaces, and language-level standards that developers use to interact with Lux.
	‚Ä¢	LRC (Lux Request for Comments): Application-layer standards, such as token standards and smart contract interfaces (e.g. fungible token specs, NFT standards, naming systems). LRC proposals are analogous to Ethereum‚Äôs ERC category, defining how applications and assets operate on Lux Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Meta: Proposals about the process itself or governance of the Lux ecosystem. Meta LPs do not alter the protocol but rather propose changes to processes, decision-making, or tools (for example, the proposal defining the LP process would be a Meta LP). These typically require community consensus to implement, similar to how Ethereum uses Meta EIPs for process changes Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Informational: Proposals that provide general guidelines, design recommendations, or other information to the community. These do not propose new features or require adoption; they are simply for disseminating best practices or design philosophies. (The community is free to follow or ignore informational LPs.)

## Tools and Commands

To help manage the LP workflow, this repository provides a Makefile and helper scripts. Common tasks include:

# Create a new LP from the template
make new

# Validate a specific LP (checks formatting, front-matter, etc.)
make validate FILE=LPs/lp-20.md

# Validate all LPs in the repository
make validate-all

# Check all hyperlinks in LP documents for validity
make check-links

# Update the index (INDEX.md) based on current LP files
make update-index

# Show statistics (e.g., counts by status or category)
make stats

# Run all checks (validation, links, etc.) before submitting a PR
make pre-pr

## Managing LP discussions (requires GitHub CLI):

For governance and transparency, each LP can have an associated discussion thread on the Lux forum or GitHub Discussions. The following commands use the GitHub CLI to create and manage proposal discussion posts:

# Create a GitHub Discussion for an LP (in the "LP Discussions" category of the repo)
gh discussion create --repo luxfi/LPs \
  --category "LP Discussions" \
  --title "LP <number>: <Proposal Title>" \
  --body "Discussion for LP-<number>: https://github.com/luxfi/LPs/blob/main/LPs/lp-<number>.md"

# List existing discussion categories (to confirm the category name or ID)
gh api repos/luxfi/LPs/discussions/categories

These tools ensure that proposal authors can easily format their submissions and that reviewers can quickly verify consistency. They are especially useful as the number of proposals grows.

## Development Roadmap

The Lux Network‚Äôs evolution is planned in phases, with each phase focusing on a set of milestones and features. This phased development roadmap provides context for many LPs (especially Standards Track proposals targeting specific phases):
	‚Ä¢	Phase 1 (Q1 2025): Foundational Governance & Core Protocol ‚Äì Establish governance structures and launch core network functionality (consensus, base chains, native token). LPs in the 0‚Äì9 range (core framework and token standard) fall under this phase.
	‚Ä¢	Phase 2 (Q2 2025): Execution Environment & Asset Standards ‚Äì Develop the execution layer (e.g. virtual machine support) and introduce asset standards (like LRC-20). This phase includes proposals like VM specifications and token standards.
	‚Ä¢	Phase 3 (Q3 2025): Cross-Chain Interoperability ‚Äì Enable seamless interaction between Lux subnets/chains and external chains. Bridge protocols (LPs 15‚Äì19) and cross-chain message formats are addressed here.
	‚Ä¢	Phase 4 (Q4 2025): Attestations & Compliance ‚Äì Introduce identity attestations, compliance frameworks, and features for regulatory integration. (Expect LPs dealing with identity, KYC/AML frameworks, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Phase 5 (Q1 2026): Privacy & Zero-Knowledge ‚Äì Implement privacy-preserving technology and zero-knowledge proof integrations (such as the Z-Chain and privacy enhancements in transactions).
	‚Ä¢	Phase 6 (Q2 2026): Data Availability & Scalability ‚Äì Improve data availability solutions (for off-chain data or rollups) and scale throughput of the network.
	‚Ä¢	Phase 7 (Q3 2026 and beyond): Application Layer Standards ‚Äì Focus on higher-level standards for DeFi, DAO governance, and dApp development to enrich the ecosystem (e.g. advanced smart contract standards, financial primitives, etc.).

See the phases/ directory for detailed specifications and design documents for each development phase. Each phase‚Äôs completion is marked by the implementation of key LPs associated with that phase.
