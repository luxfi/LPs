## Status Definitions

### üìù Draft
**Definition**: An LP that is open for discussion and is being actively worked on by its author(s).

**Requirements**:
- Must follow the [LP template](../LPs/TEMPLATE.md)
- Must have all required sections
- Can be incomplete but should indicate areas needing work

**Next Steps**:
- Author iterates based on community feedback
- Once ready, author requests advancement to Review

**Duration**: Unlimited (but becomes Stagnant after 6 months of inactivity)

### üîç Review
**Definition**: An LP that is complete and ready for formal review by the community and technical experts.

**Requirements**:
- All sections must be complete
- Reference implementation should be available (for Standards Track)
- Must address all feedback from Draft phase

**Review Types**:
- **Technical Review**: Feasibility, implementation complexity, performance impact
- **Economic Review**: Token economics, incentive alignment, market effects
- **Security Review**: Attack vectors, vulnerabilities, risk assessment

**Next Steps**:
- Address reviewer feedback
- Once reviews pass, advance to Last Call

**Duration**: 2-6 weeks depending on complexity

### ‚è∞ Last Call
**Definition**: The final review window before an LP becomes Final. This is the last chance for objections.

**Requirements**:
- All review feedback must be addressed
- No outstanding technical objections
- Security considerations fully documented

**Process**:
- 14-day public comment period
- Announced on all community channels
- Any critical issues restart the Review phase

**Next Steps**:
- If no blocking issues: advance to Final
- If issues found: back to Review

**Duration**: Exactly 14 days

### ‚úÖ Final
**Definition**: An LP that has been accepted and is considered a standard. Implementation can begin or has been completed.

**Requirements**:
- Completed Last Call with no blocking issues
- For Standards Track: implementation must be possible
- For Meta/Informational: community consensus achieved

**Characteristics**:
- Only minor editorial changes allowed
- Serves as the reference specification
- May still be Superseded by future LPs

**Duration**: Permanent (unless Superseded)

### üö´ Withdrawn
**Definition**: An LP that has been withdrawn by the author(s) and is no longer being pursued.

**Reasons**:
- Author decides not to pursue
- Fundamental flaws discovered
- Better approach identified

**Characteristics**:
- Preserved for historical reference
- Cannot be resurrected (must create new LP)
- Should document reason for withdrawal

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Deferred
**Definition**: An LP that is not being actively worked on but may be resumed in the future.

**Reasons**:
- Waiting for other LPs to be implemented first
- Requires technology not yet available
- Author temporarily unavailable

**Characteristics**:
- Can be reactivated by author or new champion
- Preserved in current state
- Not considered for implementation

### üîÑ Superseded
**Definition**: An LP that was Final but has been replaced by a newer LP.

**Requirements**:
- New LP must explicitly state it supersedes the old one
- Must provide migration path
- Original LP updated with supersession notice

**Characteristics**:
- Historical reference only
- Points to superseding LP
- Implementation should migrate to new standard

### üí§ Stagnant
**Definition**: An LP (usually Draft) that has been inactive for an extended period.

**Criteria**:
- No updates for 6+ months
- Author unresponsive to feedback
- Community discussion ceased

**Recovery**:
- Original author can reactivate
- New author can adopt with permission
- Otherwise moves to Withdrawn

## Best Practices

### For Authors
1. **Start Early**: Share ideas before drafting
2. **Engage Actively**: Respond to feedback promptly
3. **Be Specific**: Provide clear specifications
4. **Plan Ahead**: Consider implementation timeline
5. **Document Changes**: Keep changelog in LP

### For Reviewers
1. **Be Constructive**: Focus on improvements
2. **Be Timely**: Provide feedback within review periods
3. **Be Thorough**: Check all aspects (technical, economic, security)
4. **Be Clear**: State if issues are blocking or suggestions

### For Implementers
1. **Engage Early**: Participate in Draft discussions
2. **Prototype**: Build proof-of-concepts during Review
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure compliance with Final spec
4. **Report Issues**: Feed back implementation experience

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How long does the entire process take?
A: Typically 2-6 months from Draft to Final, depending on complexity and community engagement.

### Q: Can I update a Final LP?
A: Only minor editorial changes. Substantial changes require a new LP that supersedes the original.

### Q: What if my LP gets stuck in Review?
A: Address all feedback, engage with reviewers, and consider if the proposal needs fundamental changes.

### Q: Can someone else take over my Stagnant LP?
A: Yes, with your permission or after reasonable attempts to contact you.

### Q: Do all LPs need to reach Final status?
A: No. Some ideas work better as discussions, and it's okay to withdraw if a better approach emerges.
